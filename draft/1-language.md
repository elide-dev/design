People love their favorite languages; Python makes sense to Pythonistas. JavaScript and TypeScript make sense to the web development world. Java and Kotlin developers will go on for hours about the value of the JDK and JVM.

A perfect runtime would not force language choices for its developer users. Runtimes today are a mirror image of the runtime creator's language preferences: Node.js came to be because Ryan Dahl really loved C++ and JavaScript, and wanted to use JavaScript in more places (where he had to use C++ before). That was and remains great and Node was an important contribution to the world; but a future runtime, built with Node's lessons in mind, should not restrict its value proposition to just one target language.
